Mini Product Recommender System


I have used a subset of the Amazon product dataset (https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) particularly the Grocery and Gourmet Food one. Only the metadata was utilized as it contained the required information for this tasks. Furthermore to reduce computational power requirements, a fraction of the whole data was utilized.

In order to run the recommender API and front-end, you'll need to get the pickled files from my Google drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MK16wOkF-7FGlCHK3sGaph4dmm7kZggx/view?usp=drive_link) extract and place those files in the FastAPI folder.

Simple run the main.py file and access the index.html page for frontend.
